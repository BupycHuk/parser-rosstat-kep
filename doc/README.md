I look at ```\mini-kep\doc\_build\html``` for generated documentation 
and do not like what I see too much. 

Areas for improvement:

1. Change appearance of index.html
- [ ] add some text and highlighted code example
- [ ] change what is displayed on a sidebar
- [ ] change order modules listed - manualy select files 

2. Module docstrings
-  [ ] there are module docstrings, but they do not appear in documentation.
        What should be done about to see them in documentation?

3. Default argument values are ugly in documentation, what should be done about it?
- [ ] change something in documentation config? 
 		
4. Your other suggestions to docs improvements
   with aim to use this as reference for a developper 
   working with 'kep' package.
   
Write your github username along with suggestion for this task.
