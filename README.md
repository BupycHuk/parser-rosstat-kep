# mini-kep

[mini-kep] parses MS Word files from [Rosstat KEP publication][Rosstat], creates pandas dataframes with 
macroeconomic time series and saves them as [CSV files at stable URL][backend]. Inspired by [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) and 
[cookiecutter-data-science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science). 

Check documentation [here](http://mini-kep-docs.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com)
and examples [here](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/mini-kep/blob/dev/src/example1.py)

```
(1) Rosstat -> (2) mini-kep -> (3) clean CSV files -> (4) your code with R/pandas
```
1. Rosstat publishes KEP publication every month as zipped Word files
2. mini-kep parses Word files and saves output as three CSV files (annual, quarterly and monthly)
3. CSV files are available at <https://github.com/epogrebnyak/mini-kep/tree/master/data/processed/latest>, 
   or <https://goo.gl/Cr5mSZ> 
4. you can import Russian macroeconomic indicators to your R/pandas code from these files  


Parser pipeline
===============
-   **manually** (*FIXME*):
    -   download zip/rar file for a specified month [from Rosstat website]
    -   unpack MS Word files to a local folder
-   **word2csv**: convert MS Word files to single interim CSV file (see [example])
-   **csv2df**: parse interim CSV file to obtain [processed CSV files][processed CSV files at stable URL] with annual, quarterly and monthly data.

Also in [/src](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/mini-kep/tree/master/src) folder:

-   **access\_data**: sample code to download data from stable URL and save a local copy
-   **frontpage**: add tables and graphs to [README.md](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/mini-kep/blob/master/VALUES.md)

Glossary
========
In order of appearance:

**Rosstat KEP publication** - 
     monthly publication of macroeconomic time times sereis by Rosstat,  Russian statatics agency. 
	 Released as MS Word files of a web site.      
  
**Parsing specification** - 
     set of instructions used to extract data from CSV file. These instructions like table headers 
     to variable names.

**Resulting dataframes** - 
     pandas dataframes with parsing result, usually denoted as ```dfa, dfq, dfm```. 
     Hold time series at annual, quarterly and monthly frequency respectively.   

**Stable URL** - 
     a web address, from where an end user can read a canonical dataset: 
	 
    -  <https://github.com/epogrebnyak/mini-kep/tree/master/data/processed/latest/dfa.csv>.
	-  <https://github.com/epogrebnyak/mini-kep/tree/master/data/processed/latest/dfq.csv>.
	-  <https://github.com/epogrebnyak/mini-kep/tree/master/data/processed/latest/dfm.csv>.
