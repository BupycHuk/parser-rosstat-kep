#### 2018-07-02:
- `python` folder has mature code, runnable from `manage.py`
- point of focus in python code is `dispatch.evaluate()` which parsers csv text based on parameters
- `julia` and `go` folders have descriptions of minimal example
- there is no `reader.go` implementation yet,  `reader.jl` just has csv file import 
- current task is to read csv file and extract table header and datarows as explained in `reader.*` files
